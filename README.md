## New to GitHub

I have never used GitHub before, so I am learning new things everytime I use it. I've learned how to create a repository, as well as upload and commit code to GitHub.

Below is a sticker that I uploaded to our iOS Stickers app, it was also the first thing I ever did on GitHub

## New to XCode

Going into this class I have also never used XCode. I was able to learn a bunch of new things for XCode such as actually starting a project, and a few elements of coding from YouTube videos.

## New to Sketch

Sketch for me was pretty similar to other photoshop apps I've used before. I've used Photoshop, Gimp, and plenty of mobile photoshop apps in my time. So Sketch for me was easier for me to get used to than GitHub and XCode.
