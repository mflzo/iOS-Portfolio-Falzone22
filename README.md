# Matt Falzone iOS Spring 2022 portfolio

Hello, my name is Matthew Falzone. This is my portfolio of both projects and just information on my journey through coding. I'll take you through challenges, different things I've learned, and accomplishments.


## New to GitHub

I have never used GitHub before, so I am learning new things everytime I use it. I've learned how to create a repository, as well as upload and commit code to GitHub.

Over the time of using GitHub I've become more comfortable with repositories and committing code, as well as new things like joining someone elses repository and making portfolios like this one.

As of now I am comfortable with using GitHub, especially with getting code from other people and typing a README like this one.


## New to XCode

Going into this class I have also never used XCode. I was able to learn a bunch of new things for XCode such as actually starting a project, and a few elements of coding from YouTube videos.

My first XCode project was supposed to be a simple soundboard with 4 different buttons to play sounds. I had all of the visuals and buttons working but for some reason it wouldn't play the correct sound I wanted.

Later in the year during term 2 of the class, me and my friend Stephane started another project which was a Fruit Ninja type slicer game named "Bednar Slice" where you slice Mr. Bednar's head when it comes up on the screen. We would be following tutorials to code the whole game. This gave me some more experience in coding.


## New to Sketch

Sketch for me was pretty similar to other photoshop apps I've used before. I've used Photoshop, Gimp, and plenty of mobile photoshop apps in my time. So Sketch for me was easier for me to get used to than GitHub and XCode.

Sketch is something that personally for me would help me out in my journey, because coding and making things from scratch is difficult for me, I'm able to be useful in other ways such as creating art for the app or making in app designs and sprites. For example, the group project I'm a part of is a mobile game called Sky Skirmish, my teammates know what they're doing in terms of coding. So I am the art maker for the team, I create the art used in the game such as the spaceships, background, enemies, etc.

In sketch I haven't made anything too extreme, but one of the things I did make and that I'll be using for one of my apps is this app icon I made

Ultimately now I only use sketch for resizing images easier, as I did find a different photo editing software that I liked more during the year called gimp which I ended up using to edit and create photos such as my art in Sky Skirmish.


## [Soundboard](https://github.com/mflzo/YeSoundboard)

The first app I ever created was a simple Soundboard app. above is a link to the actual app's repository where you can find more information on my journey through creating and uploading the app.

This is also the main layout for the app that I have designed right now.

## [Sky Skirmish](https://github.com/WillPeyer/SkySkirmish)

Sky Skirmish was a team project about a mobile game where you play as a fighter jet and shoot enemies and objects in your way. My job for the development for this app was to create the art and sprites. So far I have created the main ship that the player will use in the game, and I am in the process of creating enemy ships.

My personal job for the project, was to create the art and sprites for the objects in the game such as the jets, debris, etc. Below is a picture of one of the ships I created for the app

The game has been finished and was posted to the appstore and is currently available for anyone to download and play! Below is the link to the app itself in the appstore

## Bednar Slice

Our ninja slicer game (which we don't have a name for yet) is currently being coded. Following the tutorials and walkthroughs from the website HackingWithSwift. A link below is provided to the tutorial we followed.

Below are 2 pictures we took to use as assets in our game, picture 1 of course being Mr. Bednar's face which will act as the object you slice, as well as the icon for the app. The second image being a background of lockers that will be the setting for the game.

Over the course of a few weeks me and Stephane created and finished Bednar Slice, and as of right now it is currently in test flight.
