# Matt Falzone iOS Spring 2022 portfolio

Hello, my name is Matthew Falzone. This is my portfolio of both projects and just information on my journey through coding. I'll take you through challenges, different things I've learned, and accomplishments.


## New to GitHub

I have never used GitHub before, so I am learning new things everytime I use it. I've learned how to create a repository, as well as upload and commit code to GitHub.

Over the time of using GitHub I've become more comfortable with repositories and committing code, as well as new things like joining someone elses repository and making portfolios like this one.


## New to XCode

Going into this class I have also never used XCode. I was able to learn a bunch of new things for XCode such as actually starting a project, and a few elements of coding from YouTube videos.

My first XCode project was supposed to be a simple soundboard with 4 different buttons to play sounds. I had all of the visuals and buttons working but for some reason it wouldn't play the correct sound I wanted.


## New to Sketch

Sketch for me was pretty similar to other photoshop apps I've used before. I've used Photoshop, Gimp, and plenty of mobile photoshop apps in my time. So Sketch for me was easier for me to get used to than GitHub and XCode.

Sketch is something that personally for me would help me out in my journey, because coding and making things from scratch is difficult for me, I'm able to be useful in other ways such as creating art for the app or making in app designs and sprites.

For example, the group project I'm a part of is a mobile game called Sky Skirmish, my teammates know what they're doing in terms of coding. So I am the art maker for the team, I create the art used in the game such as the spaceships, background, enemies, etc.


## Soundboard

The first app I ever created was a simple Soundboard app. Below is a link to the actual app's repository where you can find more information on my journey through creating and uploading the app.
